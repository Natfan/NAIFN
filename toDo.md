#TO-DO:

- Figure out why command parsing doesn't work
	- fix it
		- Solution idea: split userInput into space-seperated list and then do a comparison.
- Add voice synthesis options - on/off and engine (say or gspeak or whatever windows uses (speakeasy?))
- Add file -rw so user info can be saved
- Add a simple notes feature (i.e: "'make a note [of this]': note" ans save to file for later retreival)
- Intergrate with taskWarrior
