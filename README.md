# NAIFN
*Natural Artificial Inteligence For Netizens*

NAIFN is an attempt at an "artificial intelligence" built around assisting users with menial tasks. This is not really an AI, not yet. The plan is to respond to basic text and voice commands in a human language manner.

### Objectives:

* Allow users to interact with NAIFN through natural language, and have NAIFN respond naturally too.

* Allow users to interact with NAIFN via text or TTS.

* Allow users to add commands/functionality.

### TO DO:

* Make a natural language parser/interpreter or get an existing one working

* Add some basic personal assistant functionality, such as time/weather lookups, reminders/notes.

* Add speech-to-text for voice interaction.
